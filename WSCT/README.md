# WSCT Core [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/WSCT.Core)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WSCT.Core/)

This is the core API of the WSCT project.

It defines:

* Raw APDU command and response
* ISO7816-4 APDU
* Smart card reader and card access API
* Some *fluent* extensions method allowing fast prototyping

> Warning: this package alone doesn't give access to a concrete smart card reader. Use next package for that.

Please go to the WSCT project on [github]( https://github.com/wsct/WSCT-Core) for more information.
